<h1>Project Title: Creating a Formix form with React App</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
An interactive form that validates email address and for a successful login process in a form. This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>.

<h2>How to Run</h2>
In the project directory, you can run:

<h4>npm start</h4>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<h4>npm test</h4>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

<h4>npm run build</h4>
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
